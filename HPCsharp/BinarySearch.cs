        // There are several ways to implement a modified binary search for insertion sort.  One way is to compare with the middle array
        // element in the first step.  Another way is to compare with the largest element in the first step and then the smallest element.
        // Or to compare largest and then middle element.  It just depends if we want to optimize for search or for nearly presorted or 
        // nearly inverted - i.e. worst and best cases and in between.
        //
        // What it will boil down to is to find an index where an element is larger and an index where an element is smaller and
        // the difference between these indexes is 1 - this is the termination condition of the loop.
        // From this termination condition it seems that we must test the upper limit and then the lower limit of the array and then
        // reduce the distance between max and min indexes by 2X.
        //
        // For binary search we want to do the following:
        // Compare with the largest element, which is what we are doing in the first if statement, and if the current element is
        //   bigger then no work is done and the element stays in its current spot.
        // Compare with the smallest element and if it's smaller then we are done as well and need to move the entire array over 

        // Searches for the value within array "a", from a[ left ] to a[ right ] inclusively
        // Returns the the left-most index at which the element of the array is larger or equal to the value.
        // Thus, the return index can be between left and (right + 1)
        // Expects "a" array to be pre-sorted with the smallest element on the left and the largest on the right.
        // It would be cool if the routine worked automagically for the condition of right < left  (i.e. no  elements) - return left
        // It would be cool if the routine worked automagically for the condition of left == right (i.e. one element )
